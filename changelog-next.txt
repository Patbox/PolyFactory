  - New block that allows you to add and remove items from Shulker Boxes, bundles and any other storage api compatible item!
  - You place/remove the storage item by adding it in front/back of the block.
  - All other sides can add/remove items from item's inventory.
  - Made out of Wooden Plates, Steel Plates and a Hopper.
- Slime and Honey can now be shot out of Fluid Nozzle / Fluid Pressure Gun.
  - Added Slime and Honey splashes.
  - They deal no damage, instead giving player Sticky effect.
  - Sticky effect makes player movement speed slower by 20%, attack speed by 15% and block breaking by 15%.
  - When entity with this effect touches a wall while falling, it will slowly slide on it (similar effect to Honey Block).
- Steel Gears can now be placed like regular blocks, if player has an Axle in inventory (unless creative, where it isn't needed). You can also still place it directly on Axle.

- Increased damage done by Experience Splash x2 (compared to previously).
