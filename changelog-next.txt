- Added Moldmaking Table:
  - Alternative way to create Unfired Clay Molds without having a base/shaping item (like ingot).
  - Uses 4 Clay Balls, 1 Clay Block or 1 other Unfired Clay Molds as an input.
  - Provides Stonecutter-like ui.
  - Crafted either with 1 Copper Ingot, 1 Plank and 2 Wooden Plates in Crafting Table or by casting 1 Ingot worth of Molten Copper on a Crafting Table.
- Tweaked how Data Receivers handle incoming data.
  - Receiver can now specify if it can receive data instantly, allowing it to handle data from multiple sources.
  - Previously (and by default) all data was first stored and only handled by provider at the end of the world tick, allowing them to handle only single message per tick.
  - For example, Speaker can now play multiple sounds at the same time, rather than semi-arbitrarily selecting only one sound to play.
- Changed Cable sound to Wool (most noticable with Polymer Sound Patcher enabled).
- Fixed Orientable Cabled Blocks being replaced with Cable when placing cable in them.
- Fixed Item Reader not being rotated correctly visually.
- Fixed textures being added to "blocks" atlas, when they should be in "items".
- Fixed last slot of Mechanical Crafter not storing it's disabled property.
