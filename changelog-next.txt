  - It's 2.5 times slower than Industrial Smeltery.
  - Can hold up to 1 stacks of items as input.
  - Can hold up to 1 block of Molten Metals.
  - Uses furnace fuel to work, burning through it four times as fast.
- Added Fauced:
  - Crafted with 4 Copper Ingots, 1 Iron Ingot and 1 Stone.
  - Can be used to extract fluids from containers and pipes by using items on it.
  - When placed above Casting Table, it's used to start metal casting (requiring some base item / mold on the table).
  - When placed above Cauldron, it will also start casting metal into the full block.
- Added Casting Table:
  - Crafted with 5 Iron Ingots and 2 Smooth Stone Slabs.
  - Used for Casting recipes.
  - Can hold only single input item and single output item.
  - Can't be automated, designed for manual usage (Mechanical Spout can be used for most recipes instead).

- Added Casting Molds:
  - Have 2 types, regular / steel and clay:
    - Clay variant is made out of 4 Clay Balls and "shape item" in the middle (only clay is used).
    - Then it needs to be fired in a furnace, creating Hardened Clay Mold.

    - Steel variant is made by poring 4 ingot equivalent of Molten Steel on "shape item", destroying it, placed on a Casting Table.
    - It's unbreakable.

- Added Golden Potato on a Spring.
- Gears are now placed correctly aside of Mechanical Pump.
- Portable Fluid Tank now only provides fluids when it's pointed towards block trying to source them.
- Tweaked some default block sounds.
- Tried to improve compatibility with Lithium's Hopper optimalizations.
- Fixed fluid order being reversed in tooltips.
