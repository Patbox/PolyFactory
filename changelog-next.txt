- Added Gearshift:
  - Crafted with 4 Planks, 2 Copper Plates, 1 Steel Gear and 2 Axles.
  - Similar to Clutch, but instead of disconnecting two sides of a mechanical network, it flips it's direction.
  - Powering it with Redstone will prevent it from slipping, keeping the rotation direction as is.
  - This behaviour can be inverted with a Wrench.
- Tweaked Fluid Pipe logic to push fluids more evenly in pipes that have more than two neighbors.
- After locking Copper Pipes with a wrench you can now change which faces they point at.
- Pipe with Redstone Valve will no longer place itself as inverted by default.
- Updated texture (and internally model) of Clutch to match style of Gearshift.
- Removed some invisible quads from the Conveyor models.
