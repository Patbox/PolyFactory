- Added Molten Iron, Molten Copper and Molten Gold fluids.
- Added Smeltery (WIP):
  - Used to smelt raw ores and other metallic items into Molten Metals.
- Mechanical Pumps (and pipes powered by them) will now pull fluid blocks that are further away (as long as they are connected, by safe fluid blocks).
- Gears are now placed correctly aside of Mechanical Pump.
- Fixed fluid order being reversed in tooltips.
- Tweaked some default block sounds.
- Tried to improve compatibility with Lithium's Hopper optimalizations.
