- Updated to 1.21.10:
  - There was slight breakage in Vanilla, which wouldn't crash but break some blocks collision effects.
  - This version will still be compatible with 1.21.9 with correct behaviour!
- Removed custom Copper Nugget (vanilla has it now). Old items will migrate to vanilla one.
- Disabled the turntable rotation effect for players, as it bugged out.
