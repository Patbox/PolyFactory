### Header: <yellow><b>0.10.3+1.21.11
- Added the guidebook "Factories and you!":
  - Crafted with a Book and Iron Nugget.
  - It's a guidebook to the mod, with main goal of making it easier to pick up for new players.
  - You use it to open new ui.
  - It's still a bit early on and doesn't describe everything, but most important basics are already there.
- Added Gearshift:
  - Crafted with 4 Planks, 2 Copper Plates, 1 Steel Gear and 2 Axles.
  - Similar to Clutch, but instead of disconnecting two sides of a mechanical network, it flips it's direction.
  - Powering it with Redstone will prevent it from slipping, keeping the rotation direction as is.
  - This behaviour can be inverted with a Wrench.
- Added Deep Storage Container:
  - Crafted with 8 Steel Plates and 1 Steel Block.
  - It's a 2x2x2 multiblock (like Steam Engine) that can store items.
  - It stores 338 stacks of items (split into 8 pages of 42 stacks).
  - Pages can be changed by left-clicking the button.
  - Button's looks can be changed by having an item in cursor and then right-clicking it on the button.
  - Hoppers / Funnels / etc. do not care about pages, seeing this block as one big inventory.
- Added Item Output Buffer:
  - Crafted with 4 Steel Plates and 4 Wooden Plates.
  - It's directional storage block that acts as an extension of machine block output containers.
  - It can hold 18 stacks of items.
  - To connect it to an output of machine block, you sneak and then place it against output point of the machine (for most it's the opposite side of the input/back).
  - If you use Funnels or Hoppers on it, the output slots of connected block will also be available for them.
  - However, UI of the block will only show its own slots.
  - When opened from the front, it will allow you take items, but not place them in. When opened from the back it allows both placing and taking items.
- Tweaked Fluid Pipe logic to push fluids more evenly in pipes that have more than two neighbors.
- After locking Copper Pipes with a wrench you can now change which faces they point at.
- Slot-Aware Funnel will no longer be limited by blocks directionality when inserting items.
- Pipe with Redstone Valve will no longer place itself as inverted by default.
- Fluids are now visible in Polydex.
- Steam Engine can now be set to require redstone signal to work.
- Squeezing a Wet Sponge in Mechanical Press can now generate 1 bucket worth of water.
- Updated texture (and internally model) of Clutch to match style of Gearshift.
- Updated texture of Artificial Dye to match modern vanilla dye textures.
- Removed some invisible quads from the Conveyor models.
- Mechanical Placer should now act closer to regular player placing behaviour.
- Improved Mechanical Presses fluid output handling. Fluids can now be set as required (unused by PolyFactory).
- Fixed spelling of Faucet (from Fauced).
- Fixed Mechanical Mixer not allowing to craft recipes with fluid output even if there is enough space with input fluids taken.
- Fixed Ice and Snow not changing block-based temperature.
- Fixed Faucet block not giving you output item correctly when using last item of a stack.
- Fixed Pipes pulling fluid from waterlogged Mechanical Pumps and Copper Pipes with Redstone Valve.
- Fixed Filtered Copper Pipe rendering as a solid block rather than transparently.
- Fixed advancements not working when other mod updated the Factory Tools library.
- Fixed missing strings for list and game event in Data Extractor.

- Added Moldmaking Table:
  - Alternative way to create Unfired Clay Molds without having a base/shaping item (like ingot).
  - Uses 4 Clay Balls, 1 Clay Block or 1 other Unfired Clay Molds as an input.
  - Provides Stonecutter-like ui.
  - Crafted either with 1 Copper Ingot, 1 Plank and 2 Wooden Plates in Crafting Table or by casting 1 Ingot worth of Molten Copper on a Crafting Table.
- Added Digital Clock:
  - It sends Game Time data every tick.
  - It also displays current time.
  - Crafted with 4 Steel Plates, 1 Redstone Chip, 3 Copper Ingots and a Clock.
- Tweaked how Data Receivers handle incoming data.
  - Receiver can now specify if it can receive data instantly, allowing it to handle data from multiple sources.
  - Previously (and by default) all data was first stored and only handled by provider at the end of the world tick, allowing them to handle only single message per tick.
  - For example, Speaker can now play multiple sounds at the same time, rather than semi-arbitrarily selecting only one sound to play.
- Improved Funnel Blocks:
  - You can set max size of item stack put to/extracted from container Funnel is attached to.
    - Worth noting it won't bypass specific limit of conveyor / inventories. Conveyor still can only transport 16 items at the time.
  - You can configure it using a Wrench. You can also use the F special action to open an UI to input the value directly.
  - Changed the collision shape to be the same as Trapdoor, matching other similar blocks from the mod.
  - Model was made slightly slimmer, to match the hitbox better.
  - The block support collision shape was unchanged (aka kept as full cube), to prevent blocks in existing worlds from popping when updated.
- Tweaked Mechanical Ejector, Mechanical Fan and Conveyor code to move players more accurately and handle player's riding mobs (horses/etc).
- Changed Cable sound to Wool (most noticeable with Polymer Sound Patcher enabled).
- Placing Cabled Data Blocks without cable will now flip their facing direction when pressing shift.
- Fixed Orientable Cabled Blocks being replaced with Cable when placing cable in them.
- Fixed Item Reader not being rotated correctly visually.
- Fixed textures being added to "blocks" atlas, when they should be in "items".
- Fixed block outline allowing to see through a block for most PolyFactory blocks:
  - This was not fixed for blocks that have texture with partial alpha, such as colored lamps, Item Reader, Hologram Projector and Nixie Tubes.
  - Additionally it might improve the block rendering performance slightly.
- Fixed last slot of Mechanical Crafter not storing it's disabled property.
