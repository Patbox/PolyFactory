<yellow><item 'polyfactory:steam_engine'></> is a 2x3x2 block that generates rotational energy.
<nl>
It's the best way to generate a lot of energy, without requiring a lot of connecting infrastructure,
at the cost of requiring fuel to work.
<nl2>
To power it, you just need to put any furnace-compatible fuel into it.
<nl>
Once it has fuel, it requires 10 seconds to get to it's full capacity,
burning the fuel a lot faster than once it gets going. It consumes fuel 16 times faster
than a furnace, providing rotational speed of 110 RPM and stress capacity of 100 u.
<nl2>
While by default it automatically activates once it has fuel, you can also set it to
require active redstone signal for it to start.
