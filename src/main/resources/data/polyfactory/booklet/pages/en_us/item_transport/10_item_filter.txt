<yellow>Item Filter</> is an item that allows you to limit which items are accepted by
<item 'hopper'>s, <item 'polyfactory:funnel'>s and <item 'polyfactory:item_splitter'>s.
<nl2>
To configure it, use it while not targeting any interactive blocks. It will then open an interface, which allows you to
put up to 9 different items to filter against. Do note that the filter will only copy the item into itself, without requiring
the original to be placed there permanently.
<nl2>
Additionally, you can change whatever filter should check against item data
(enchantments, damage, color, etc.) of provided items or just check if they have equal type.
<nl>
You can also set whatever this filter only allows provided item or only prevents them.
<nl2>
To make a block use that filter, you just need to click it while holding it.
<item 'hopper'> and <item 'polyfactory:funnel'> only allow a single filter, while <item 'polyfactory:item_splitter'>
can take two (one for the green/left and one for the red/right output).
To take it out, just click it again (Hopper requires you to hold shift).
