<yellow><item 'polyfactory:artificial_dye'></> is a custom dye item that can be used as a replacement for vanilla
dyes in context of crafting/coloring anything that supports dynamic colors, like leather armor,
<item 'minecraft:firework_star'>, signs, <item 'polyfactory:colored_lamp'> and more.
<nl2>
To craft it, you need to use a <u><blue><pagelink 'polyfactory:basics/50_temperature'>heated</*>
<item 'polyfactory:mixer'>. Then you need to get some <item 'polyfactory:saw_dust'>,
vanilla dyes and other controlling ingredients (see below).
<nl>
Then, you need to put them in the mixer and start mixing!
As an extra ingredients you can use:
- Vanilla dyes, other <item 'polyfactory:artificial_dye'> - Used to get colors for mixin, same logic as leather.
- <item 'polyfactory:saw_dust'> (<blue><u><polydex 'polyfactory:saw_dust'>recipe</*>) - Needed as a base
(if not mixing with other <item 'polyfactory:artificial_dye'>) and to halve the change of ingredients below (delta=32 without, 16 for 1, 8 for 2 and so on).
- <item 'redstone'> - Removes blue and green color by *delta*.
- <item 'slime_ball'> - Removes red and blue by *delta*.
- <item 'lapis_lazuli'> - Removes red and green by *delta*.
- <item 'bone_meal'> - Increases all colors by *delta* (makes it lighter).
- <item 'polyfactory:coal_dust'> - Lowers all colors by *delta* (makes it darker).
