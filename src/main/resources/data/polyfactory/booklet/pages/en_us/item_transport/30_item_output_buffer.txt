<yellow><item 'polyfactory:item_output_buffer'></> is as item storage block, that acts as extension
of output slots of crafting machines connected to it. It can store up to 18 stacks of items.
<nl2>
To connect it to a machine you need to place it at the "output" of it. Usually it is positioned on the opposite side
of the input / front, through it might differ for other blocks (for example <item 'polyfactory:placer'> can be connected
from any non-operative) side.
</>
When connected, things such as <item 'hopper'>s and <item 'polyfactory:funnel'>s will also see
the output slots of the machine connected to it in addition to buffer's own slots. These slots won't be visible when player opens it.
