<yellow><item 'polyfactory:chain_drive'></> is a rotational transmission block.
It allows to transmit rotational energy on higher distance with fewer blocks required.
It can also be used with <item 'polyfactory:chain_lift'> for transportation.
<nl2>
Chain Drives can be placed facing any axis. To connect them together, you need to use some
<item 'iron_chain'>s. The amount of chains needed is equal to rounded up doubled distance between the Chain Drives.
The max distance of single connection is 32 blocks, however chain drives can be chained allowing for long-distance lines.
<nl>
The connection between the chain drives can't have too big of an angle, with the limit being 33 degrees.
<nl2>
By using the <yellow><item 'polyfactory:chain_lift'></> on the <item 'polyfactory:chain_drive'> you will attach it,
after which it will be moving with the chain. You can think of it as Minecarts. By default, Chain Lifts ridden by player
will only ride in direction player is looking, but that can be disabled with a <item 'polyfactory:wrench'>.
Otherwise, it will always pick the first path it can find.
<nl>
<item 'polyfactory:chain_lift'>s can be powered by <item 'redstone'>, which makes them drop currently held entity.
