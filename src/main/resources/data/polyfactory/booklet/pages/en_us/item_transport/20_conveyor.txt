<yellow><item 'polyfactory:conveyor'></> is as block that allows to transport items and entities.
It requires <u><blue><pagelink 'polyfactory:rotation/00_about'>rotational energy</*> to work, through relays purely on
the speed of it (but not directionality of the rotation!), without adding any extra stress to the system. Conveyors can also be used to relay the rotational energy
further.
<nl2>
Conveyors are directional and connect with each other as long as they point in the same direction and are next to each other.
The conveyor can go straight, diagonally (both up and down) and directly upwards.
<nl2>
When entity is on top of the powered <item 'polyfactory:conveyor'>, it will be pushed in direction the conveyor is facing.
In case of vertical ones, entities won't be affected.
<nl>
For item transport, dropping items directly, using <item 'hopper'>s or <item 'polyfactory:funnel'> will allow the
<item 'polyfactory:conveyor'> to pick it up, with the stack size limit of 16. Then the stack will move in specified
direction, without being able to despawn. If <item 'polyfactory:conveyor'> points directly into some blocks,
such as <item 'polyfactory:press'>, <item 'polyfactory:mixer'>, <item 'hopper'> and alike, items will be put into it directly.
<item 'polyfactory:conveyor'> will also be able to take items out of some of them (for example <item 'polyfactory:mechanical_spout'>
and <item 'polyfactory:mechanical_drain'>).
<nl2>
Regular <item 'polyfactory:conveyor'> do not allow items to go directly up or down, only allowing them to move horizontally and diagonally.
For that, you need to use <yellow><item 'polyfactory:sticky_conveyor'></>, which functions pretty much the same,
with bonus of allowing vertical item movement. They don't extend this functionality to entity movement currently through.
To get a <item 'polyfactory:sticky_conveyor'>, you can either craft <item 'polyfactory:conveyor'> with a <item 'slime_ball'>
or use it directly in world.
