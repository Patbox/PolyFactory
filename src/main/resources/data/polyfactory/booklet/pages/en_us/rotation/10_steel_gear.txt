<yellow><item 'polyfactory:steel_gear'></> is a rotational transmission block and a crafting ingredient.
It can be connected with other regular steel gears by placing them on the same plane, while pointing in
the same axis.
<nl2>
<yellow><item 'polyfactory:large_steel_gear'></> is a rotational transmission block.
It can be connected with other large steel gears by placing them perpendicularly to each other,
so their outer part touch visually (the axles need to be pointing perpendicularly).
<nl2>
<item 'polyfactory:steel_gear'> and <item 'polyfactory:large_steel_gear'> can be connected with each other when
placed diagonally on the same plane. Additionally, depending on which gear is powered, the speed and stress capacity
will change. For example, when the <item 'polyfactory:steel_gear'> powers the <item 'polyfactory:large_steel_gear'>,
the rotation speed will be halved on the large gear side, but capacity will double. Swapping which one gets powered]
will also swap the effected values (halved capacity, but doubled speed).
<nl2>
To place any of the gears, you either use them on existing <item 'polyfactory:axle'> block or have at least
1 <item 'polyfactory:axle'> in inventory.
