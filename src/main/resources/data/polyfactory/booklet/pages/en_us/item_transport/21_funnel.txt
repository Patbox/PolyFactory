It can face in all horizontal directions and down. It's facing direction is controlled by block face it's placed again
or player facing direction if placed on top.
<nl>
It also has 2 modes of operation:
- To Conveyor - pulls items out of containers and puts them on the conveyor.
- From Conveyor - pulls items from conveyor and puts them in the container.

By default, the mod is selected depending on how it's placed. If it's placed without a Conveyor below, it will always
default to "To Conveyor" mode. When placed on conveyor.
If it's placed in conveyor's facing direction, it will use "From Conveyor" mode.
When placed in opposite direction it will always use "To Conveyor" mode.
When placed sideways, it will select a mod that takes from the targeted block to the other one.
Naturally this can be changed with a <u><blue><pagelink 'polyfactory:basics/10_wrench'><item 'polyfactory:wrench'></*>.
