<yellow><item 'polyfactory:mixer'></> is a 1x2x1 item crafting machine block. It required rotational energy to work.
It has 6 input slots, 2 bucket worth fluid storage and 3 output slot.
<nl2>
Most recipes only require main input slot to be set, pressing it into something else.
For most recipes only output is another item, but some might output (optionally) extra fluids.
After each press there is a slight cooldown indicated by the press returning back up.
<nl>
For hopper/storage access, the main slot is loaded via front
of the block, while head slot is accessed by providing items from the side. The output slot is accessible from the back.
This block can be accessed directly by Conveyors.
<nl2>
To power this block you need to connect it on the left or right side of the top part.
The stress generated by this machine depends on currently crafted recipe.
When inactive it doesn't generate any stress.
