<yellow><item 'polyfactory:fluid_tank'></> is a block used to store fluids.
<nl2>
By itself, it can store up to 6 buckets/blocks worth of fluid. It can store different types of fluid at the same time,
through some of them might react with each other. Fluid Tank blocks can connect with each other, allowing creation of
bigger, connected tanks. There is no limit about shape or number of tanks.
<nl2>
Fluid can be accessed with a <item 'polyfactory:pipe'> or other fluid blocks with direct access.
When pulling fluid out of it, ideally you should do it from the bottom layer, as only accessible fluids are ones that
are visually within the <item 'polyfactory:fluid_tank'>.
<nl>
When broken fluids are lost.
