<yellow>Windmill</> is one of the simpler power generating structures you can make.
<nl>
To make it, you need a single <item 'polyfactory:axle'> and 2-8 <item 'polyfactory:windmill_sail'>s.
First you need to place the <item 'polyfactory:axle'>. Then you use <item 'polyfactory:windmill_sail'> on the axle
to convert it into a windmill. Windmills only single energy output, determined by axis of the axle and player facing
direction. Do note that windmills can only be placed horizontally.

The speed generated by the Windmill depends on  the dimension, biome, height and the weather.
In The Overworld, the higher, the more speed and capacity it will generate, in The Nether most is generated around y=64
and in The End it's the same everywhere.
<nl>
In ocean biomes, the speed is multiplied by 1.35, on beach and mountain biomes by 1.2 and in old growth biomes by 1.1.
<nl>
When it's raining, the speed will be additionally multiplied by 1.1.
<nl2>
Stress capacity of the windmill is derived from both speed and amount of sails. The more sails you have and the faster
it spins the more of capacity you will have available.
<nl2>
If you wanted to customize the windmill a bit more, the sail can be dyed with both vanilla dyes and <u><blue><pagelink 'polyfactory:misc/20_artificial_dye'><item 'polyfactory:artificial_dye'></*>.
