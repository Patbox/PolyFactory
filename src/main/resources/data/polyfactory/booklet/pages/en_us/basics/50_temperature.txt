<yellow>Temperature</> is a mechanic used by some machines for crafting, it is determined by things such as biome
and block under affected machine. The values of temparature are contained between -1 to 1
(through they all might not be achievable).
<nl2>
For biomes, ambient temperature is equal to:
- Really hot biomes like Nether: 0.15,
- Hot biomes like desert, badlands and savanna: 0.08,
- Cold, snowy biomes: -0.08,
- Really cold / icy biomes like Ice Spikes: -0.15.
<nl2>
And for block temperature:
- Lava: 0.85,
- Lit Campfires and Fire: 0.45,
- Torch: 0.15,
- Snow: -0.08,
- Ice: -0.1.
<nl2>
The final effective temperature is equal to value further from 0 based on both block temperature and biome temperature.
