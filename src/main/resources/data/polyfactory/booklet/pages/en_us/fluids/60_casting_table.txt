<yellow><item 'polyfactory:casting_table'></> is a block that allows you to craft things with liquids.
<nl2>
It doesn't do anything by itself, as you need to place a <item 'polyfactory:faucet'> connected to some fluid source.
Then by placing the ingredient item in the <item 'polyfactory:casting_table'>, you can start crafting by
clicking the <item 'polyfactory:faucet'>. If the ingredient is valid and there was enough fluid, casting process will start,
which first pulls the fluid out and then waits for it to cool down. Once it cools down you can take out the crafted item.
<nl2>
While this setup can be automated by powering the <item 'polyfactory:faucet'> with redstone and using a Hopper below the
table, you should use <u><blue><pagelink '/crafting/70_mechanical_spout'><item 'polyfactory:mechanical_spout'></*> instead,
as it is faster. Through it will have slightly different sent of recipes.
