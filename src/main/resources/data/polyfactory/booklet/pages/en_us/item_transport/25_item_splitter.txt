<yellow><item 'polyfactory:splitter'></> is item routing block that works on top of the
<u><blue><pagelink 'polyfactory:item_transport/20_conveyor'><item 'polyfactory:conveyor'></*>.
<nl2>
It has 1 input and 3 outputs. By default, it will split items equally between all 3 outputs (assuming all of them have
a conveyor or other compatible block). To use it for sorting, left (red) and right (green) outputs can be configured
with an <u><blue><pagelink 'polyfactory:item_transport/10_item_filter'>Item Filter</*>. Items are prioritized to go
in direction in which filter matches them. In case of failure of filtered outputs, the item will continue moving forwards.
