<yellow><item 'polyfactory:smeltery'></> is a 3x3x3 multi-block that allows you to melt certain materials.
<nl>
Similarly to <u><blue><pagelink './50_primitive_smeltery'><item 'polyfactory:primitive_smeltery'></*>, its
used to get Molten fluids (which usually give higher yield than using Furnace), later used for crafting with
<item 'polyfactory:casting_table'> and <item 'polyfactory:mechanical_spout'>.
<nl2>
<item 'polyfactory:smeltery'> can melt up to 9 items at the same time, while being able to hold up to
24-blocks worth of fluid
<nl>
To work, this block requires Furnace-compatible fuel (such as Coal), while using it 3 times as fast as a Furnace.
<nl2>
Unlike most other blocks, to make this block you need to build it in world.
To do it, first you need <item 'polyfactory:smeltery_core'>, 22 <item 'deepslate_bricks'>
and 3 <item 'polyfactory:steel_block'>.

Then you just need to build a hollow cube out of them (aka center block is empty).
Position of the <item 'deepslate_bricks'> and <item 'polyfactory:steel_block'> doesn't matter,
with only requirement being that <item 'polyfactory:smeltery_core'> is in a middle of one of the walls
facing outwards. Once you do it, just click the <item 'polyfactory:smeltery_core'> and it will turn into
the <item 'polyfactory:smeltery'>. If you placed something wrong, it will highlight the incorrect blocks instead.
