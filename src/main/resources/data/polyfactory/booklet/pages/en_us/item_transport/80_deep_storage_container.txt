<yellow><item 'polyfactory:deep_storage_container'></> is a 2x2x2 item storage block.
<nl2>
It can store up to 336 stacks of items (or in other words 12 and 2/5 chests), however only
42 can be visible at the same time, as the ui is split into 8 pages. This limitation doesn't affect
blocks that interact with the block, such as <item 'polyfactory:funnel'> or <item 'minecraft:hopper'>.
<nl2>
Buttons of the UI by default display the number of the slot, but they can be replaced with any item
by holding it in cursor and then right-clicking the select button. It can be cleared by right-clicking
with empty cursor.
