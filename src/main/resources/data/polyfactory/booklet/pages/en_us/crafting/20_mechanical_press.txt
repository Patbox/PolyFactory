<yellow><item 'polyfactory:grinder'></> is a 1x2x1 item crafting machine block.
It's one of the first machines you can (and need to) make.
<nl2>
This machine allows you to grind down certain items to different ones, which is required to do to get certain materials.
When grinding, there might be multiple resulting items, with some of them only having a chance to appear.
<nl2>
To power this block you need to connect it either on top or on bottom to some rotational energy transmission blocks.
The stress generated by this machine depends on currently crafted recipe and speed at which it's currently rotated.
When inactive it always requires 1 stress unit.
