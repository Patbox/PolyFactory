PolyFactory is a server side tech-mod adding more ways to automate and create things.
By default, it doesn't apply any visible changes in the world, as it's players goal to do so.
<nl2>
To get started, you first need to craft the <item 'polyfactory:grinder'>, which will allow you to create
<item 'polyfactory:coal_dust'>, <item 'polyfactory:saw_dust'> and many other items (through the first
two will be most important for crafting).
<nl2>
To power the <item 'polyfactory:grinder'> you need to craft the <item 'polyfactory:hand_crank'>.
It's most primitive, but only one you can get block you can use to generate the mechanical power.
Place it on top of the <item 'polyfactory:grinder'> facing downwards. To use it just constantly click it,
as it will generate enough power to get the <item 'polyfactory:coal_dust'>, which you get from grinding
<item 'minecraft:coal'> and <item 'minecraft:charcoal'>.
<nl2>
After you get enough <item 'polyfactory:coal_dust'>, you will want to get some <item 'polyfactory:steel_ingot'>s.
You can initially get them by crafting <item 'polyfactory:coal_dust'>, <item 'minecraft:redstone_dust'> and 2 <item 'minecraft:iron_ingot'>
into <item 'polyfactory:steel_alloy_mixture'> and then smelting it in a <item 'minecraft:furnace'>, <item 'minecraft:blast_furnace'>
or via smelting with a <item 'polyfactory:primitive_smeltery'>.
<nl2>
From there, you can get and craft more and more items, which you can read more about in this guide or by check in their recipes in Polydex.
For the progression line, you can take suggestions from PolyFactory's advancements tab.
