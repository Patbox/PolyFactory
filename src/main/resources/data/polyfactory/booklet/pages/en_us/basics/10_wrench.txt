<yellow><item 'polyfactory:wrench'></> is a tool that can be used to configure and modify select blocks and entities.
<nl2>
While you hold it, by looking at configurable block or entity, the sidebar will appear showing all current settings
and their values. To using the wrench, you will change the settings value to next available now. You can also sneak to
change the settings to "previous" one.
<nl2>
By using the offhand swap button, it will instead try to set the value based on the context. For example when targeting
block that faces certain direction, it will now point at the face you targeted (and again sneaking might change the result).
<nl2>
Attacking the block will allow you to change the currently selected setting to the next one, with sneaking moving it one back.
The currently selected setting is then remembered per block/entity type.
