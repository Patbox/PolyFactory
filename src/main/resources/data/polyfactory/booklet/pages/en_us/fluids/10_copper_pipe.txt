<yellow><item 'polyfactory:pipe'></> is a block that allows you to transport fluids around, both for storage,
placement / draining and crafting purposes.

Regular <item 'polyfactory:pipe'> can connect directionally with other pipes, allowing it to split and join fluid flow.
They also will try to connect to any other fluid input/output or pipe, through that functionality can be disabled per
block with a <u><blue><pagelink '/basics/10_wrench'><item 'polyfactory:wrench'></*>.

<yellow><item 'polyfactory:redstone_valve_pipe'></> is a pipe variant, which can be used to connect / disconnect pipe
network automatically by applying redstone power to it.
This pipe also can only connect in axis it is facing.

<yellow><item 'polyfactory:filtered_pipe'></> is a pipe variant, allows you to filter out fluids passing through it, handling
it both as whitelist or a blacklist depending on the need. To set the filter you need to use item associated with certain
fluid on it, for example Bucket of Water to set it to filtering water or Iron Ingot to filter out Molten Iron.
If not configured, the filter will automatically set itself to first fluid it gets in contact with.
